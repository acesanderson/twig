This tutorial will guide you through the basics.\n\n---\n\n### Sway Config Customization: A Short Tutorial\n\n**1. What is the Sway Config?**\nSway's behavior, keybindings, appearance, and more are defined in its configuration file. It's a simple, human-readable text file that Sway reads on startup and reload.\n\n**2. Where is the Config File?**\nSway looks for its configuration in these locations, in order:\n*   `~/.config/sway/config` (most common for user customizations)\n*   `/etc/xdg/sway/config`\n*   `/etc/sway/config` (system-wide default)\n\nIf `~/.config/sway/config` doesn't exist, you should copy the system-wide default to your user directory to start customizing:\n```bash\nmkdir -p ~/.config/sway\ncp /etc/sway/config ~/.config/sway/config\n```\n\n**3. Backup Your Config! (Crucial First Step)**\nBefore making any changes, *always* back up your current configuration. This way, if something goes wrong, you can easily revert.\n```bash\ncp ~/.config/sway/config ~/.config/sway/config.bak\n```\n\n**4. Open the Config File**\nUse your favorite text editor (e.g., `nano`, `vim`, `micro`, `code`):\n```bash\nnano ~/.config/sway/config\n```\n\n**5. How to Apply Changes (Reload Sway)**\nAfter saving your changes to the config file, you need to tell Sway to reload it. The default keybinding for this is:\n*   **`$mod+Shift+C`** (where `$mod` is usually the Super/Windows key).\n\nAlternatively, you can run the command `swaymsg reload` in a terminal.\n\n---\n\n### Common Customizations\n\nLet's look at some popular things you'll want to change.\n\n#### a. Set Your Mod Key (`$mod`)\nThe \"Mod\" key is central to Sway's keybindings. By default, it's usually `Mod4` (the Super/Windows key).\n```ini\n# You can change this to Mod1 (Alt) if you prefer\nset $mod Mod4\n```\n\n#### b. Change Your Default Terminal\nSway ships with `alacritty` as the default in its example config. Change this to your preferred terminal emulator.\n```ini\n# Find this line and modify it\nset $term alacritty # Or kitty, gnome-terminal, st, xterm, etc.\n\n# Then you'll see keybindings using it, like:\nbindsym $mod+Return exec $term\n```\n\n#### c. Change Your Default Browser\nSimilar to the terminal, define a variable for your browser and use it in a keybinding.\n```ini\n# Add this line if it's not there\nset $browser firefox # Or chromium, brave, etc.\n\n# Add a keybinding for it (e.g., Mod+b)\nbindsym $mod+b exec $browser\n```\n\n#### d. Set Your Wallpaper\nSway uses the `output` command to configure monitors and wallpapers.\n```ini\n# Add this line at the end or in the output section\n# Replace /path/to/your/image.jpg with the actual path\noutput * bg /path/to/your/image.jpg fill\n\n# 'fill' scales the image to fit the screen without distortion, covering the entire output.\n# Other options: 'fit', 'stretch', 'tile', 'center'\n```\n*To find your monitor names*: Open a terminal and run `swaymsg -t get_outputs`. Then you can target specific monitors: `output <monitor_name> bg ...`\n\n#### e. Modify/Add Keybindings\nKeybindings are the core of interacting with Sway. The syntax is `bindsym [$mod+]<key> <command>`.\n*   **Open the launcher:**\n    ```ini\n    # Default is usually dmenu/wofi\n    bindsym $mod+d exec wofi --show drun # or dmenu_run\n    ```\n*   **Kill a window:**\n    ```ini\n    bindsym $mod+Shift+q kill\n    ```\n*   **Toggle fullscreen:**\n    ```ini\n    bindsym $mod+f fullscreen toggle\n    ```\n*   **Move workspace to other output:**\n    ```ini\n    bindsym $mod+Shift+comma move workspace to output left\n    bindsym $mod+Shift+period move workspace to output right\n    ```\n\n#### f. Adjust Gaps\nGaps are the spaces between windows and between windows and the screen edge.\n```ini\n# Inner gaps (between windows)\ngaps inner 10\n\n# Outer gaps (between windows and screen edge)\ngaps outer 5\n```\n\n#### g. Configure Swaybar\nThe bar at the bottom/top of your screen is Swaybar (or i3bar compatible). Its configuration is usually within a `bar { ... }` block. You can change position, font, colors, and what status information is displayed.\n```ini\nbar {\n    position top\n    # font pango: JetBrainsMono Nerd Font 10\n    # colors {\n    #     background #333333\n    #     statusline #ffffff\n    #     focused_workspace #4C7899 #285577 #ffffff\n    #     ...\n    # }\n    # status_command i3status # or waybar\n}\n```\n*Note:* Many users replace `i3status` with `waybar` for more advanced status bar features.\n\n---\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n*   **Sway won't start or looks broken:** This usually means you have a syntax error in your config. Revert to your `config.bak` file, or comment out recent changes until Sway loads correctly.\n*   **Check logs:** You can often find error messages in Sway's logs:\n    ```bash\n    journalctl --user -u sway # (for systemd users)\n    ```\n    Or check `~/.config/sway/sway.log` if you've configured Sway to log there.\n\n---\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point for customizing your Sway experience! Don't be afraid to experiment, but always remember to back up your config first.

This tutorial focuses on common, easy-to-implement changes to get you started.\n\n---\n\n### Easy Sway Customizations: A Brief Guide\n\n**1. Locate & Prepare Your Config File**\n\nSway uses a configuration file to define its behavior.\n\n*   **Default Location:** Sway first looks in `~/.config/sway/config`. If it doesn't find it, it uses `/etc/sway/config`.\n*   **Your First Step:** Copy the system-wide default config to your user directory so you can customize it without affecting the system default.\n\n    ```bash\n    mkdir -p ~/.config/sway\n    cp /etc/sway/config ~/.config/sway/config\n    ```\n\n*   **Backup (Crucial!):** Before making any changes, always back up your new config.\n\n    ```bash\n    cp ~/.config/sway/config ~/.config/sway/config.bak\n    ```\n\n*   **Open for Editing:** Use your favorite text editor (e.g., `nano`, `vim`, `micro`):\n\n    ```bash\n    nano ~/.config/sway/config\n    ```\n\n**2. Apply Your Changes (Reload Sway)**\n\nAfter saving your edits, tell Sway to reload its configuration:\n\n*   **Keybinding (Default):** Press `$mod+Shift+C` (where `$mod` is usually the Super/Windows key).\n*   **Terminal Command:** Run `swaymsg reload` in any terminal.\n\n---\n\n### Common & Easy Customizations\n\nLet's dive into the most frequently changed settings.\n\n#### a. Set Your Mod Key (`$mod`)\n\nThe `$mod` key is the primary modifier for most Sway keybindings. It's usually `Mod4` (the Super/Windows key).\n\n*   **Find this line:**\n    ```ini\n    set $mod Mod4\n    ```\n*   **Change it (optional):** You can change `Mod4` to `Mod1` if you prefer to use the Alt key for your modifier.\n\n#### b. Change Your Default Terminal\n\nSway's default config often uses `alacritty`. Change this to your preferred terminal.\n\n*   **Find this line:**\n    ```ini\n    set $term alacritty\n    ```\n*   **Modify it:**\n    ```ini\n    set $term kitty        # Or gnome-terminal, st, xterm, etc.\n    ```\n    (Note: Keybindings like `bindsym $mod+Return exec $term` will now open your chosen terminal.)\n\n#### c. Set Your Wallpaper\n\nSway uses the `output` command to set wallpapers.\n\n*   **Add this line (anywhere, but often at the end or in the `output` section):**\n    ```ini\n    output * bg /path/to/your/image.jpg fill\n    ```\n    *   Replace `/path/to/your/image.jpg` with the actual path to your image.\n    *   `*` applies it to all outputs. You can use specific monitor names (e.g., `output DP-1 bg ...`).\n    *   `fill` scales the image to cover the screen without distortion. Other options: `fit`, `stretch`, `tile`, `center`.\n\n#### d. Add a Keybinding for Your Browser\n\nIt's handy to have a quick way to open your browser.\n\n*   **Define your browser (if not already present):**\n    ```ini\n    set $browser firefox   # Or chromium, brave, etc.\n    ```\n*   **Add a new keybinding (e.g., Mod+b):**\n    ```ini\n    bindsym $mod+b exec $browser\n    ```\n\n#### e. Adjust Gaps Between Windows\n\nMake your desktop look tidier by adjusting the space between windows and the screen edge.\n\n*   **Inner Gaps (between windows):**\n    ```ini\n    gaps inner 10\n    ```\n*   **Outer Gaps (between windows and screen edge):**\n    ```ini\n    gaps outer 5\n    ```\n    (These values are in pixels. Experiment to find what you like.)\n\n#### f. Customize Swaybar (The Bottom/Top Bar)\n\nThe `bar { ... }` block controls Swaybar's appearance.\n\n*   **Position:** Change where the bar appears.\n    ```ini\n    bar {\n        position top # Or bottom\n        # ... other bar settings\n    }\n    ```\n*   **Font:**\n    ```ini\n    bar {\n        # ...\n        font pango: JetBrainsMono Nerd Font 10 # Example, use your desired font and size\n        # ...\n    }\n    ```\n*   **Colors:** (Uncomment and modify these if you want custom colors)\n    ```ini\n    bar {\n        # ...\n        colors {\n            background #333333\n            statusline #ffffff\n            focused_workspace #4C7899 #285577 #ffffff\n            # ... more color options\n        }\n        # ...\n    }\n    ```\n    *Tip:* Many users replace `i3status` (Swaybar's default status program) with `waybar` for more features and visual flair, but `waybar` requires its own separate configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Troubleshooting Tips\n\n*   **Sway won't load / looks broken:** You likely have a syntax error in your config. Revert to your `config.bak` file, or comment out recent changes until Sway loads correctly.\n*   **Check logs:** For more detailed error messages, use:\n    ```bash\n    journalctl --user -u sway -f  # (for systemd users, use -f to follow live logs)\n    ```\n\n---\n\nThis covers the most common and easiest ways to start personalizing your Sway experience. Don't hesitate to experiment with the settings, but always remember to back up your config first!
